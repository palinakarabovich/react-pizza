# Pizza ordering web application

This is a frontend part of an internet pizzeria, which allows filtering, sorting, searching pizzas, and adding them to the cart.

The code is divided into components, to get data, the request is sent to the server, a global store is created to store application data, the code is strictly typed with TypeScript, and the data added to the cart is stored in LocalStorage.
